(don't forget to set the debug release profile flags in Cargo.toml)
cargo build --release

(runs program with call-stack profiling enabled)
sudo perf record -g ./target/release/application tests/100k/benchmark_100k 

(reports collected call-graph information with filter of 0.5 to remove noisy calls, navigate with arrowkeys '+' and 'a')
sudo perf report -g `graph, 0.5, caller` 

(produces annotated? assembly for application)
sudo perf annotate

(creates a flame graph from data recorded by perf)
sudo perf script | sudo ~/FlameGraph-master/stackcollapse-perf.pl | sudo ~/FlameGraph-master/flamegraph.pl > flame.svg

(tests whether files produced by "test_run" are equal, as a santiy check, 0 means they are equal)
cmp tests/correct/test1_naive.out tests/correct/test1_naive2.out ; echo $?

(run benchmarks)
cargo bench 

(run callgrind on executable to generate stats file for analyzing with kcachegrind gui app)
valgrind --tool=callgrind --dump-instr=yes --collect-jumps=yes --simulate-cache=yes ./target/release/application
