sudo perf report -g `graph, 0.5, caller` 

(produces annotated? assembly for application)
sudo perf annotate

(creates a flame graph from data recorded by perf)
sudo perf script | sudo ~/FlameGraph-master/stackcollapse-perf.pl | sudo ~/FlameGraph-master/flamegraph.pl > flame.svg

(tests whether files produced by "test_run" are equal, as a santiy check, 0 means they are equal)
cmp tests/Ak/benchmark_Ak_N_test.out tests/Ak/benchmark_Ak_N_testB.out ; echo $?

(run benchmarks)
cargo bench
